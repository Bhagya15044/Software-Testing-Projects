                                          **Test Strategy for vwo.app.com** 

**Introduction**

This document describes the test strategy for the web application apo.vwo.com. This tool allows users to create A/B tests, view dashboards, and manage their accounts**.**

**Objective**

The agenda is to test the application to make sure it works as expected, is easy to use for end users, fast, secure, and shows correct results to the end user**.**

**Features to Be Tested (In Scope)**

* User sign-up (new users can register)

* Login and logout

* Dashboard

  **Features Not to Be Tested (Out of Scope)**

* Mobile apps (Android/iOS)

* Admin internal dashboard (if not available)

* Payment system (if handled by another team)

**Types of Testing We Will Do**

* Functional Testing: to check features work as expected

* UI Testing: to check if interface is clean and buttons/menus work

* API Testing: test backend services (using Postman)

* Performance Testing: test app speed under load (using JMeter or k6)

* Security Testing: check for vulnerabilities (like broken login)

* Compatibility Testing: test on different browsers/device (chrome, Mozilla Firefox)

* Usability Testing: test if the app is ease to use for end users

* Regression Testing: Testing older application after new changes.

**Tools Used**

* Postman – for API testing

* Selenium – for automation

* JIRA – for bug tracking

* Excel sheet – to write test cases

* Browser Stack – to check on different browsers
