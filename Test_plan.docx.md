**Test Strategy**

The first step is to create test scenarios and test cases for the various features in

Scope.

While developing test cases, we'll use a number of test design techniques.

o Equivalence Class Partition

o Boundary Value Analysis

o Decision Table Testing

o State Transition Testing

o Use Case Testing

 We also use our expertise in creating Test Cases by applying the below:

o Error Guessing

o Exploratory Testing

• We prioritize the Test Cases

We then report the bugs in bug tracking tool and send dev. management

the defect found on that day in a status end of the day email.

As part of the Testing, we will perform the below types of Testing:

o Smoke Testing and Sanity Testing

o Regression Testing and Retesting

o Usability Testing, Functionality & UI Testing

• We repeat Test Cycles until we get the quality product.

**Entry and Exit Criteria**

The below are the entry and exit criteria for every phase of Software Testing Life

Cycle:

Requirement Analysis

**Entry Criteria:**

• Once the testing team receives the Requirements Documents or details

about the Project

**Exit Criteria:**

• List of Requirements are explored and understood by the Testing team

• Doubts are cleared

**Test Execution:**

**Entry Criteria:**

• Test Scenarios and Test Cases Documents are signed-off by the Client

• Application is ready for Testing

**Exit Criteria:**

• Test Case Reports, Defect Reports are ready

**Test Closure:**

**Entry Criteria:**

• Test Case Reports, Defect Reports are ready

**Exit Criteria:**

• Test Summary Reports

**Tools**

The following are the list of Tools we will be using in this Project:

• JIRA Bug Tracking Tool

**Risks and Mitigations**

The following are the list of risks possible and the ways to mitigate them:

**Risk:** Non-Availability of a Resource

**Mitigation:** Backup Resource Planning

**Approvals:**

Team will send different types of documents for Client Approval like below:

• Test Plan

• Test Scenarios

• Test Cases

• Reports

Testing will only continue to the next steps once these approvals are done
